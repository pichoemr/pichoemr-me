      <h1>Who am I?</h1>
      <p>
        I am Emric Pichonnier, passionate about computer science ever since I got my first computer. I realized my passion by obtaining my bachelor's degree followed by my Master's at the University of La Rochelle. I completed my Master's degree through an alternating program while working as a fullstack developer.
        <br /><br />
        After obtaining my degree, I was hired by the company where I did my alternating program as a fullstack developer. During this period, I completed several development projects for other companies such as Fitness Park. Armed with these experiences, I decided to embark on the adventure of becoming a freelancer.
        <br /><br />
        Being able to work on projects, whether they are completed or not, using new technologies or not, and varying from the ordinary to the more eccentric, allows me to fully live out my passions!
        <br /><br />
        Feel free to take a closer look at my projects and skills, and don't hesitate to contact me so that we can work together on your exciting project!
        <br /><br />
        See you soon,
        <br />
        Emric
